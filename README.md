Short Explaination Of Our Project-

•	Many students in India are unable to take quality education due to multiple reasons. Through this site, we provide them access to quality education in every aspect.	We have sorted and provided the content in a simplest, easy and understandable manner.Our material can be accessed anytime and anywhere easily. Other than studies, we also provide some rejuvenating activities.Some top educational websites do not provide free 11th /12th content and test series.Even if they provide free education, the contents do not cover whole syllabus.Also, in these websites, focus is on providing pdfs and online lectures due to which students are less interactive with teachers and unable to ask their queries as well.The Masterminds Classroom gives them access to new technologies of learning. Our Classroom typically focusses on the candidates perusing JEE/MHT-CET/11th -12th BOARDS exams.This webpage was designed such that students can learn new things and use them in future as well.
